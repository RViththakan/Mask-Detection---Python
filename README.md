# Mask-Detection---Python

Welcome to the Mask Detection repository! This project focuses on detecting whether individuals are wearing masks or not using computer vision techniques.

**About**

In this repository, you will find:

Datasets containing images of people with and without masks.
Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for training machine learning models and performing mask detection.
Pre-trained models for mask detection.
Documentation and resources related to the project.

**Data**

The datasets provided include images of individuals captured from various sources, with annotations indicating whether they are wearing masks or not.

**Models**

We have trained several machine learning models including:

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Transfer learning models like MobileNet, ResNet, etc.
These models are trained on the provided datasets and evaluated based on their performance metrics.

**Usage**

You can utilize this project for:

Real-time detection of individuals wearing masks in images or videos.
Integration with security systems, cameras, or access control systems for enforcing mask-wearing policies.
Analyzing compliance with mask-wearing regulations in public spaces.

**How to Use**

To get started:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Explore the datasets and notebooks provided.
Run the notebooks to train models or perform mask detection on sample images or videos.
Use the pre-trained models for mask detection in your own applications.

**Contributions**

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have ideas for improvements, additional features, or better models, feel free to fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
